in some way you are always being lectured on how things are not going too well and how you should learn to teach better. i am not going to berate you for the bad work you are doing and indicate how it can definitely be improved that is not my intention. as a matter of fact we have very good students coming into cal tech and during the years we found them getting better and better. now how it is done i dont know. i wonder if you know. i dont want to interfere with the system it is very good. only two days ago we had a conference in which we decided that we dont have to teach a course in elementary quantum mechanics in the graduate school any more. when i was a student they didnt even have a course in quantum mechanics in the graduate school it was considered too difficult a subject. when i first started to teach we had one. now we teach it to undergraduates. we discover now that we dont have to have elementary quantum mechanics for graduates from other schools.
