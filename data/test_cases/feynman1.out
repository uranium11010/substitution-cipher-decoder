what is science richard p. feynman i thank mr. derose for the opportunity to join you science teachers. i also am a science teacher. i have much experience only in teaching graduate students in physics and as a result of the experience i know that i dont know how to teach. i am sure that you who are real teachers working at the bottom level of this hierarchy of teachers instructors of teachers experts on curricula also are sure that you too dont know how to do it otherwise you wouldnt bother to come to the convention. the subject what is science is not my choice. it was mr. deroses subject. but i would like to say that i think that what is science is not at all equivalent to how to teach science and i must call that to your attention for two reasons. in the first place from the way that i am preparing to give this lecture it may seem that i am trying to tell you how to teach science i am not at all in any way because i dont know anything about small children. i have one so i know that i don t know. the other is i think that most of us because there is so much talk and so many papers and so many experts in the field have some kind of a feeling of lack of selfconfidence.
