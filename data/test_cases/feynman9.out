manuals i began to discover there were formulas applicable to electricity in relating the current and resistance and so on. one day looking at the formulas in some book or other i discovered a formula for the frequency of a resonant circuit which was f pi sqrtlc where l is the inductance and c the capacitance of the circle you laugh but i was very serious then. pi was a thing with circles and here is pi coming out of an electric circuit. where was the circle do those of you who laughed know how that comes about i have to love the thing. i have to look for it. i have to think about it. and then i realized of course that the coils are made in circles. about half a year later i found another book which gave the inductance of round coils and
