why is it getting pushed down because we are able to teach better in the university and that is because the students coming up are better trained. what is science of course you all must know if you teach it. thats common sense. what can i say if you dont know every teachers edition of every textbook gives a complete discussion of the subject. there is some kind of distorted distillation and watereddown and mixedup words of francis bacon from some centuries ago words which then were supposed to be the deep philosophy of science. but one of the greatest experimental scientists of the time who was really doing something william harvey said that what bacon said science was was the science that a lord chancellor would do. he spoke of making observations but omitted the vital factor of judgment about what to observe and what to pay attention to. and so what science is is not what the philosophers have said it is and certainly not what the teacher editions say it is. what it is is a problem which i set for myself after i said i would give this talk. after some time i was reminded of a little poem a centipede was happy quite until a toad in fun said pray which leg comes after which this raised his doubts to such a pitch he fell distracted in the ditch not knowing how to run. all my life i have been doing science and known what it was but what i have come to tell you which foot comes after which i am unable to do it and furthermore i am worried by the analogy with the poem that when i go home i will no longer be able to do any research. there have been a lot of attempts by the various press reporters to get some kind of a capsule of this talk i prepared it only a little time ago so it was impossible but i can see them all rushing out now to write some sort of headline which says the professor called the president of nsta a toad. under these circumstances of the difficulty of the subject and my dislike of philosophical exposition i will present it in a very unusual way. i am just going to tell
