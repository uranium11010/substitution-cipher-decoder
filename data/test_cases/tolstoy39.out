anecdote ended. though it was unintelligible why he had told it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated prince hippolytes social tact in so agreeably ending pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst. after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and where. chapter vi having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests began to take their leave. pierre was ungainly. stout about the average height broad with huge red hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away. besides this he was absent minded. when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generals threecornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general asked him to restore it. all his absentmindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression. anna pavlovna turned toward him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre. when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are opinions but you see what a capital goodnatured fellow i am. and everyone including anna pavlovna felt this. prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened indifferently to his wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the hall. prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass. go in annette or
