andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation. one cant everywhere say all one thinks mon cher. well have you at last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence. pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him. really i dont yet know. i dont like either the one or the other. but you must decide on something your father expects it. pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor and had remained away till he was twenty. when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now go to petersburg look round and choose your profession. i will agree to anything. here is a letter to prince vasili and here is money. write to me all about it and i will help you in everything. pierre had already been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on anything. it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking. pierre rubbed his forehead. but he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening. that is all nonsense. prince andrew again interrupted him let us talk business. have you been to the horse guards no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you. there is a war now against napoleon. if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army but to help england
