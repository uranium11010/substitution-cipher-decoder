and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back. why is it so long thought pierre. it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but refrained from touching it. pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. he looked up dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant face. its empty. he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly. dolokhov jumped down. he smelt strongly of rum. well done. fine fellow. theres a bet for you. devil take you came from different sides. the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money. dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak. pierre jumped upon the window sill. gentlemen who wishes to bet with me ill do the same thing he suddenly cried. even without a bet there tell them to bring me a bottle. ill do it. bring a bottle let him do it let him do it said dolokhov smiling. what next have you gone mad. no one would let you. why you go giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices. ill drink it lets have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window. they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying. no youll never manage him that way said anatole. wait a bit and ill get round him. listen ill take your bet tomorrow but now we are all going to s. come on then cried pierre.
