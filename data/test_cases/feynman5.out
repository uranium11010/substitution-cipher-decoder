too difficult for children. we used to weave colored paper through vertical strips and make patterns. the kindergarten teacher was so amazed that she sent a special letter home to report that this child was very unusual because he seemed to be able to figure out ahead of time what pattern he was going to get and made amazingly intricate patterns. so the tile game did do something to me. mathematics is looking for patterns. i would like to report other evidence that mathematics is only patterns. when i was at cornell i was rather fascinated by the student body which seems to me was a dilute mixture of some sensible people in a big mass of dumb people studying home economics etc. including lots of girls. i used to sit in the cafeteria with the students and eat and try to overhear their conversations and see if there was one intelligent word coming out. you can imagine my surprise when i discovered a tremendous thing it seemed to me. i listened to a conversation between two girls and one was explaining that if you want to make a straight line you see you go over a certain number to the right for each row you go up that is if you go over each time the same amount when you go up a row you make a straight line. a deep principle of analytic geometry it went on. i was rather amazed. i didnt realize the female mind was capable of understanding analytic geometry. she went on and said suppose you have another line coming in from the other side and you want to figure out where they are going to intersect. suppose on one line you go over two to the right for every one you go up and the other lines go over three to the right for every one that goes up and they start twenty steps apart etc. i was flabbergasted. she figured out where the intersection was. it turned out that one girl was explaining to the other how to knit argyle socks. therefore i did learn a lesson the female mind is capable of understanding analytic geometry. those people who have for years been insisting in the face of all obvious evidence to the contrary that the male and female are equally capable of rational thought may have something. the difficulty may
