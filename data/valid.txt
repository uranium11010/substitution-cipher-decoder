what is science rich
ard p. feynman i tha
nk mr. derose for th
e opportunity to joi
n you science teache
rs. i also am a scie
nce teacher. i have 
much experience only
 in teaching graduat
e students in physic
s and as a result of
 the experience i kn
ow that i dont know 
how to teach. i am s
ure that you who are
 real teachers worki
ng at the bottom lev
el of this hierarchy
 of teachers instruc
tors of teachers exp
erts on curricula al
so are sure that you
 too dont know how t
o do it otherwise yo
u wouldnt bother to 
come to the conventi
on. the subject what
 is science is not m
y choice. it was mr.
 deroses subject. bu
t i would like to sa
y that i think that 
what is science is n
ot at all equivalent
 to how to teach sci
ence and i must call
 that to your attent
ion for two reasons.
 in the first place 
from the way that i 
am preparing to give
 this lecture it may
 seem that i am tryi
ng to tell you how t
o teach science i am
 not at all in any w
ay because i dont kn
ow anything about sm
all children. i have
 one so i know that 
i don t know. the ot
her is i think that 
most of us because t
here is so much talk
 and so many papers 
and so many experts 
in the field have so
me kind of a feeling
 of lack of selfconf
idence. in some way 
you are always being
 lectured on how thi
ngs are not going to
o well and how you s
hould learn to teach
 better. i am not go
ing to berate you fo
r the bad work you a
re doing and indicat
e how it can definit
ely be improved that
 is not my intention
. as a matter of fac
t we have very good 
students coming into
 cal tech and during
 the years we found 
them getting better 
and better. now how 
it is done i dont kn
ow. i wonder if you 
know. i dont want to
 interfere with the 
system it is very go
od. only two days ag
o we had a conferenc
e in which we decide
d that we dont have 
to teach a course in
 elementary quantum 
mechanics in the gra
duate school any mor
e. when i was a stud
ent they didnt even 
have a course in qua
ntum mechanics in th
e graduate school it
 was considered too 
difficult a subject.
 when i first starte
d to teach we had on
e. now we teach it t
o undergraduates. we
 discover now that w
e dont have to have 
elementary quantum m
echanics for graduat
es from other school
s. why is it getting
 pushed down because
 we are able to teac
h better in the univ
ersity and that is b
ecause the students 
coming up are better
 trained. what is sc
ience of course you 
all must know if you
 teach it. thats com
mon sense. what can 
i say if you dont kn
ow every teachers ed
ition of every textb
ook gives a complete
 discussion of the s
ubject. there is som
e kind of distorted 
distillation and wat
ereddown and mixedup
 words of francis ba
con from some centur
ies ago words which 
then were supposed t
o be the deep philos
ophy of science. but
 one of the greatest
 experimental scient
ists of the time who
 was really doing so
mething william harv
ey said that what ba
con said science was
 was the science tha
t a lord chancellor 
would do. he spoke o
f making observation
s but omitted the vi
tal factor of judgme
nt about what to obs
erve and what to pay
 attention to. and s
o what science is is
 not what the philos
ophers have said it 
is and certainly not
 what the teacher ed
itions say it is. wh
at it is is a proble
m which i set for my
self after i said i 
would give this talk
. after some time i 
was reminded of a li
ttle poem a centiped
e was happy quite un
til a toad in fun sa
id pray which leg co
mes after which this
 raised his doubts t
o such a pitch he fe
ll distracted in the
 ditch not knowing h
ow to run. all my li
fe i have been doing
 science and known w
hat it was but what 
i have come to tell 
you which foot comes
 after which i am un
able to do it and fu
rthermore i am worri
ed by the analogy wi
th the poem that whe
n i go home i will n
o longer be able to 
do any research. the
re have been a lot o
f attempts by the va
rious press reporter
s to get some kind o
f a capsule of this 
talk i prepared it o
nly a little time ag
o so it was impossib
le but i can see the
m all rushing out no
w to write some sort
 of headline which s
ays the professor ca
lled the president o
f nsta a toad. under
 these circumstances
 of the difficulty o
f the subject and my
 dislike of philosop
hical exposition i w
ill present it in a 
very unusual way. i 
am just going to tel
l you how i learned 
what science is. tha
ts a little bit chil
dish. i learned it a
s a child. i have ha
d it in my blood fro
m the beginning. and
 i would like to tel
l you how it got in.
 this sounds as thou
gh i am trying to te
ll you how to teach 
but that is not my i
ntention. im going t
o tell you what scie
nce is like by how i
 learned what scienc
e is like. my father
 did it to me. when 
my mother was carryi
ng me it is reported
 i am not directly a
ware of the conversa
tion my father said 
that if its a boy he
ll be a scientist. h
ow did he do it he n
ever told me i shoul
d be a scientist. he
 was not a scientist
 he was a businessma
n a sales manager of
 a uniform company b
ut he read about sci
ence and loved it. w
hen i was very young
the earliest story i
 knowwhen i still at
e in a high chair my
 father would play a
 game with me after 
dinner. he had bough
t a whole lot of old
 rectangular bathroo
m floor tiles from s
ome place in long is
land city. we sat th
em up on end one nex
t to the other and i
 was allowed to push
 the end one and wat
ch the whole thing g
o down. so far so go
od. next the game im
proved. the tiles we
re different colors.
 i must put one whit
e two blues one whit
e two blues and anot
her white and then t
wo bluesi may want t
o put another blue b
utit must be a white
. you recognize alre
ady the usual insidi
ous cleverness first
 delight him in play
 and then slowly inj
ect material of educ
ational value. well 
my mother who is a m
uch more feeling wom
an began to realize 
the insidiousness of
 his efforts and sai
d mel please let the
 poor child put a bl
ue tile if he wants 
to. my father said n
o i want him to pay 
attention to pattern
s. it is the only th
ing i can do that is
 mathematics at this
 earliest level. if 
i were giving a talk
 on what is mathemat
ics i would already 
have answered you. m
athematics is lookin
g for patterns. the 
fact is that this ki
ndergarten had some 
effect. we had a dir
ect experimental tes
t at the time i got 
to kindergarten. we 
had weaving in those
 days. theyve taken 
it out its too diffi
cult for children. w
e used to weave colo
red paper through ve
rtical strips and ma
ke patterns. the kin
dergarten teacher wa
s so amazed that she
 sent a special lett
er home to report th
at this child was ve
ry unusual because h
e seemed to be able 
to figure out ahead 
of time what pattern
 he was going to get
 and made amazingly 
intricate patterns. 
so the tile game did
 do something to me.
 mathematics is look
ing for patterns. i 
would like to report
 other evidence that
 mathematics is only
 patterns. when i wa
s at cornell i was r
ather fascinated by 
the student body whi
ch seems to me was a
 dilute mixture of s
ome sensible people 
in a big mass of dum
b people studying ho
me economics etc. in
cluding lots of girl
s. i used to sit in 
the cafeteria with t
he students and eat 
and try to overhear 
their conversations 
and see if there was
 one intelligent wor
d coming out. you ca
n imagine my surpris
e when i discovered 
a tremendous thing i
t seemed to me. i li
stened to a conversa
tion between two gir
ls and one was expla
ining that if you wa
nt to make a straigh
t line you see you g
o over a certain num
ber to the right for
 each row you go up 
that is if you go ov
er each time the sam
e amount when you go
 up a row you make a
 straight line. a de
ep principle of anal
ytic geometry it wen
t on. i was rather a
mazed. i didnt reali
ze the female mind w
as capable of unders
tanding analytic geo
metry. she went on a
nd said suppose you 
have another line co
ming in from the oth
er side and you want
 to figure out where
 they are going to i
ntersect. suppose on
 one line you go ove
r two to the right f
or every one you go 
up and the other lin
es go over three to 
the right for every 
one that goes up and
 they start twenty s
teps apart etc. i wa
s flabbergasted. she
 figured out where t
he intersection was.
 it turned out that 
one girl was explain
ing to the other how
 to knit argyle sock
s. therefore i did l
earn a lesson the fe
male mind is capable
 of understanding an
alytic geometry. tho
se people who have f
or years been insist
ing in the face of a
ll obvious evidence 
to the contrary that
 the male and female
 are equally capable
 of rational thought
 may have something.
 the difficulty may 
just be that we have
 never yet discovere
d a way to communica
te with the female m
ind. if it is done i
n the right way you 
may be able to get s
omething out of it. 
now i will go on wit
h my own experience 
as a youngster in ma
thematics. another t
hing that my father 
told meand i cant qu
ite explain it becau
se it was more an em
otion than a telling
was that the ratio o
f the circumference 
to the diameter of a
ll circles was alway
s the same no matter
 what the size. that
 didnt seem to me to
o unobvious but the 
ratio had some marve
lous property. that 
was a wonderful numb
er a deep number pi.
 there was a mystery
 about this number t
hat i didnt quite un
derstand as a youth 
but this was a great
 thing and the resul
t was that i looked 
for pi everywhere. w
hen i was learning l
ater in school how t
o make the decimals 
for fractions and ho
w to make i wrote an
d thinking i recogni
zed a friend wrote t
hat it equals pi the
 ratio of circumfere
nce to diameter of a
 circle. the teacher
 corrected it to i i
llustrate these thin
gs to show an influe
nce. the idea that t
here is a mystery th
at there is a wonder
 about the number wa
s important to me no
t what the number wa
s. very much later w
hen i was doing expe
riments in the labor
atory i mean my own 
home laboratoryfiddl
ing aroundno excuse 
me i didnt do experi
ments i never did i 
just fiddled around.
 gradually through b
ooks and manuals i b
egan to discover the
re were formulas app
licable to electrici
ty in relating the c
urrent and resistanc
e and so on. one day
 looking at the form
ulas in some book or
 other i discovered 
a formula for the fr
equency of a resonan
t circuit which was 
f pi sqrtlc where l 
is the inductance an
d c the capacitance 
of the circle you la
ugh but i was very s
erious then. pi was 
a thing with circles
 and here is pi comi
ng out of an electri
c circuit. where was
 the circle do those
 of you who laughed 
know how that comes 
about i have to love
 the thing. i have t
o look for it. i hav
e to think about it.
 and then i realized
 of course that the 
coils are made in ci
rcles. about half a 
year later i found a
nother book which ga
ve the inductance of
 round coils and squ
are coils and there 
were other pis in th
ose formulas. i bega
n to think about it 
again and i realized
 that the pi did not
 come from the circu
lar coils. i underst
and it better now bu
t in my heart i stil
l dont quite know wh
ere that circle is w
here that pi comes f
rom. when i was stil
l pretty young i don
t know how old exact
ly i had a ball in a
 wagon i was pulling
 and i noticed somet
hing so i ran up to 
my father to say tha
t when i pull the wa
gon the ball runs to
 the back and when i
 am running with the
 wagon and stop the 
ball runs to the fro
nt. why how would yo
u answer he said tha
t nobody knows he sa
id its very general 
though it happens al
l the time to anythi
ng anything that is 
moving tends to keep
 moving anything sta
nding still tries to
 maintain that condi
tion. if you look cl
ose you will see the
 ball does not run t
o the back of the wa
gon where you start 
from standing still.
 it moves forward a 
bit too but not as f
ast as the wagon. th
e back of the wagon 
catches up with the 
ball which has troub
le getting started m
oving. its called in
ertia that principle
. i did run back to 
check and sure enoug
h the ball didnt go 
backwards. he put th
e difference between
 what we call it ver
y distinctly. regard
ing this business ab
out names and words 
i would tell you ano
ther story. we used 
to go up to the cats
kill mountains for v
acations. in new yor
k you go to the cats
kill mountains for v
acations. the poor h
usbands had to go to
 work during the wee
k but they would com
e rushing out for we
ekends and stay with
 the families. on th
e weekends my father
 would take me for w
alks in the woods. h
e often took me for 
walks and we learned
 all about nature an
d so on in the proce
ss. but the other ch
ildren friends of mi
ne also wanted to go
 and tried to get my
 father to take them
. he didnt want to b
ecause he said i was
 more advanced. im n
ot trying to tell yo
u how to teach becau
se what my father wa
s doing was with a c
lass of just one stu
dent if he had a cla
ss of more than one 
he was incapable of 
doing it. so we went
 alone for our walk 
in the woods. but mo
thers were very powe
rful in those days a
s they are now and t
hey convinced the ot
her fathers that the
y had to take their 
own sons out for wal
ks in the woods. so 
all fathers took all
 sons out for walks 
in the woods on sund
ay afternoon. the ne
xt day monday we wer
e playing in the fie
lds and this boy sai
d to me see that bir
d standing on the wh
eat there whats the 
name of it i said i 
havent got the sligh
test idea. he said i
ts a brownthroated t
hrush. your father d
oesnt teach you much
 about science. i sm
iled to myself becau
se my father had alr
eady taught me that 
that doesnt tell me 
anything about the b
ird. he taught me se
e that bird. its a b
rownthroated thrush 
but in germany its c
alled a halzenflugel
 and in chinese they
 call it a chung lin
g and even if you kn
ow all those names f
or it you still know
 nothing about the b
ird. you only know s
omething about peopl
e what they call the
 bird. now that thru
sh sings and teaches
 its young to fly an
d flies so many mile
s away during the su
mmer across the coun
try and nobody knows
 how it finds its wa
y and so forth. ther
e is a difference be
tween the name of th
e thing and what goe
s on. the result of 
this is that i canno
t remember any bodys
 name and when peopl
e discuss physics wi
th me they often are
 exasperated when th
ey say the fitzceoni
n effect and i ask w
hat is the effect an
d i cant remember th
e half of it. i woul
d like to say a word
 or two may i interr
upt my little words 
and definitions beca
use it is necessary 
to learn the words. 
that doesnt mean jus
t because it is not 
science that we dont
 have the words. we 
are not talking abou
t what to teach we a
re talking about wha
t science is. it is 
not science to know 
how to change centig
rade to fahrenheit. 
its necessary but it
 is not exactly scie
nce. in the same sen
se if you were discu
ssing what art is yo
u wouldnt say art is
 the knowledge of th
e fact that a b penc
il is softer than a 
h pencil. its a dist
rict difference. tha
t doesnt mean an art
 teacher shouldnt te
ach that or that an 
artist gets along ve
ry well if he doesnt
 know that. actually
 you can find out in
 a minute by trying 
it but thats a scien
tific way that art t
eachers may not thin
k of explaining. in 
order to talk to eac
h other we have to h
ave words and thats 
all right. its a goo
d idea to try to see
 the difference and 
its a good idea to k
now when we are teac
hing the tools of sc
ience such as words 
and when we are teac
hing science itself.
