disconcerted by this
 reception. he had j

an embroidered court

 stars on his breast

refined french in wh

 not only spoke but 
thought and with the
 gentle patronizing 
intonation natural t
o a man of importanc
e who had grown old 
in society and at co

her hand presenting 
to her his bald scen

 post for his son bu
t others were trying
 through the dowager
 empress marya fedor
ovna to secure it fo

vlovna almost closed
 her eyes to indicat
e that neither she n
or anyone else had a
 right to criticize 
what the empress des
ired or was pleased 
with. baron funke ha
s been recommended t
o the dowager empres

all she said in a dr

 as she named the em

 face suddenly assum
ed an expression of 
profound and sincere
 devotion and respec

ss and this occurred
 every time she ment
ioned her illustriou

ed that her majesty 
had deigned to show 
baron funke beaucoup
 destime and again h
er face clouded over
 with sadness. the p
rince was silent and
 looked indifferent.
 but with the womanl
y and courtierlike q
uickness and tact ha
bitual to her anna p
avlovna wished both 
to rebuke him for da
ring to speak as he 
had done of a man re
commended to the emp

 time to console him
 so she said now abo
ut your family. do y
ou know that since y
our daughter came ou
t everyone has been 
enraptured by her th
ey say she is amazin
gly beautiful. the p
rince bowed to signi
fy his respect and g
ratitude. i often th
ink she continued af
ter a short pause dr
awing nearer to the 
prince and smiling a
miably at him as if 
to show that politic
al and social topics
 were ended and the 
time had come for in
timate conversationi

 and she smiled her 
ecstatic smile. i ca

t would you have me 
do he said at last. 
you know i did all a
 father could for th
eir education and th
ey have both turned 
out fools. hippolyte
 is at least a quiet
 fool but anatole is
 an active one. that
 is the only differe
nce between them. he
 said this smiling i
n a way more natural
 and animated than u
sual so that the wri
nkles round his mout
h very clearly revea
led something unexpe
ctedly coarse and un
pleasant. and why ar
e children born to s

u were not a father 
there would be nothi

you with said anna p
avlovna looking up p
ensively. i am your 
faithful slave and t
o you alone i can co

that is how i explai

 the quickness of me
mory and perception 
befitting a man of t

d by a movement of t
he head that he was 
considering this inf

w he said at last ev
idently unable to ch

of his thoughts that
 anatole is costing 
me forty thousand ru
bles a year and he w
ent on after a pause
 what will it be in 
five years if he goe

 was gradually filli

they belonged. princ

bolkonskaya known as
 la femme la plus se

she had been married
 during the previous
 winter and being pr
egnant did not go to
 any large gathering
s but only to small 
receptions. prince v

 had come with morte
mart whom he introdu
ced. the abbe morio 
and many others had 
also come. the most 
fascinating woman in
 petersburg. to each
 new arrival anna pa
vlovna said you have
 not yet seen my aun

 my aunt and very gr
avely conducted him 
or her to a little o
ld lady wearing larg
e bows of ribbon in 
her cap who had come
 sailing in from ano
ther room as soon as
 the guests began to
 arrive and slowly t
urning her eyes from
 the visitor to her 
aunt anna pavlovna m
entioned each ones n
ame and then left th

formed the ceremony 
of greeting this old
 aunt whom not one o
f them knew not one 
of them wanted to kn

pavlovna observed th
ese greetings with m
ournful and solemn i
nterest and silent a

in the same words ab
out their health and
 her own and the hea

ho thank god was bet

visitor though polit
eness prevented his 
showing impatience l
eft the old woman wi
th a sense of relief
 at having performed
 a vexatious duty an
d did not return to 
her the whole evenin
g. the young princes
s bolkonskaya had br
ought some work in a
 gold embroidered ve
lvet bag. her pretty
 little upper lip on
 which a delicate da
rk down was just per
ceptible was too sho
rt for her teeth but
 it lifted all the m
ore sweetly and was 
especially charming 
when she occasionall
y drew it down to me
et the lower lip. as
 is always the case 
with a thoroughly at
tractive woman her d
efectthe shortness o
f her upper lip and 
her halfopen mouthse
emed to be her own s
pecial and peculiar 
form of beauty. ever
yone brightened at t
he sight of this pre

ones who looked at h

too were becoming li

and health. all who 
talked to her and at
 each word saw her b
right smile and the 
constant gleam of he
r white teeth though
t that they were in 
a specially amiable 
mood that day. the l
ittle princess went 
round the table with
 quick short swaying
 steps her workbag o
n her arm and gaily 
spreading out her dr

fa near the silver s
amovar as if all she
 was doing was a ple
asure to herself and
 to all around her. 
i have brought my wo

 and addressing all

turning to her hoste

small reception and 
just see how badly i

 spread out her arms
 to show her shortwa

in french turning to

 what this wretched 
war is for she added
 addressing prince v

she turned to speak 
to his daughter the 
beautiful helene. wh

a. one of the next a
rrivals was a stout 
heavily built young 
man with closecroppe
d hair spectacles th
e lightcolored breec
hes fashionable at t
hat time a very high
 ruffle and a brown 
dress coat. this sto
ut young man was an 
illegitimate son of 
count bezukhov a wel
lknown grandee of ca
therines time who no
w lay dying in mosco
w. the young man had
 not yet entered eit
her the military or 
civil service as he 
had only just return
ed from abroad where
 he had been educate
d and this was his f
irst appearance in s
ociety. anna pavlovn
a greeted him with t
he nod she accorded 
to the lowest hierar
chy in her drawing r
oom. but in spite of
 this lowestgrade gr
eeting a look of anx
iety and fear as at 
the sight of somethi
ng too large and uns
uited to the place c
ame over her face wh
en she saw pierre en
ter. though he was c
ertainly rather bigg
er than the other me
n in the room her an
xiety could only hav
e reference to the c
lever though shy but
 observant and natur
al expression which 
distinguished him fr
om everyone else in 
that drawing room. i
t is very good of yo
u monsieur pierre to
 come and visit a po
or invalid said anna
 pavlovna exchanging
 an alarmed glance w
ith her aunt as she 
conducted him to her
. pierre murmured so
mething unintelligib
le and continued to 
look round as if in 
search of something.
 on his way to the a
unt he bowed to the 
little princess with
 a pleased smile as 
to an intimate acqua
intance. anna pavlov
nas alarm was justif
ied for pierre turne
d away from the aunt
 without waiting to 
hear her speech abou
t her majestys healt
h. anna pavlovna in 
dismay detained him 
with the words do yo
u know the abbe mori
o he is a most inter
esting man. yes i ha
ve heard of his sche
me for perpetual pea
ce and it is very in
teresting but hardly
 feasible. you think
 so rejoined anna pa
vlovna in order to s
ay something and get
 away to attend to h
er duties as hostess
. but pierre now com
mitted a reverse act
 of impoliteness. fi
rst he had left a la
dy before she had fi
nished speaking to h
im and now he contin
ued to speak to anot
her who wished to ge
t away. with his hea
d bent and his big f
eet spread apart he 
began explaining his
 reasons for thinkin
g the abbes plan chi
merical. we will tal
k of it later said a
nna pavlovna with a 
smile. and having go
t rid of this young 
man who did not know
 how to behave she r
esumed her duties as
 hostess and continu
ed to listen and wat
ch ready to help at 
any point where the 
conversation might h
appen to flag. as th
e foreman of a spinn

tices here a spindle

se than it should an
d hastens to check t

 in proper motion so
 anna pavlovna moved
 about her drawing r
oom approaching now 
a silent now a toono
isy group and by a w
ord or slight rearra
ngement kept the con
versational machine 
in steady proper and
 regular motion. but
 amid these cares he
r anxiety about pier
re was evident. she 
kept an anxious watc
h on him when he app
roached the group ro
und mortemart to lis
ten to what was bein
g said there and aga
in when he passed to
 another group whose
 center was the abbe
. pierre had been ed
ucated abroad and th
is reception at anna
 pavlovnas was the f
irst he had attended
 in russia. he knew 
that all the intelle
ctual lights of pete
rsburg were gathered
 there and like a ch
ild in a toyshop did
 not know which way 
to look afraid of mi
ssing any clever con
versation that was t
o be heard. seeing t
he selfconfident and
 refined expression 
on the faces of thos
e present he was alw
ays expecting to hea
r something very pro
found. at last he ca
me up to morio. here
 the conversation se
emed interesting and
 he stood waiting fo
r an opportunity to 
express his own view
s as young people ar
e fond of doing. cha
pter iii anna pavlov
nas reception was in
 full swing. the spi
ndles hummed steadil
y and ceaselessly on
 all sides. with the
 exception of the au
nt beside whom sat o
nly one elderly lady
 who with her thin c
areworn face was rat
her out of place in 
this brilliant socie
ty the whole company
 had settled into th
ree groups. one chie
fly masculine had fo
rmed round the abbe.
 another of young pe
ople was grouped rou
nd the beautiful pri
ncess helene prince 
vasilis daughter and
 the little princess
 bolkonskaya very pr
etty and rosy though
 rather too plump fo
r her age. the third
 group was gathered 
round mortemart and 
anna pavlovna. the v
icomte was a niceloo
king young man with 
soft features and po
lished manners who e
vidently considered 
himself a celebrity 
but out of politenes
s modestly placed hi
mself at the disposa
l of the circle in w
hich he found himsel
f. anna pavlovna was
 obviously serving h
im up as a treat to 
her guests. as a cle
ver maitre dhotel se
rves up as a special
ly choice delicacy a
 piece of meat that 
no one who had seen 
it in the kitchen wo
uld have cared to ea
t so anna pavlovna s
erved up to her gues
ts first the vicomte
 and then the abbe a
s peculiarly choice 
morsels. the group a
bout mortemart immed
iately began discuss
ing the murder of th
e duc denghien. the 
vicomte said that th
e duc denghien had p
erished by his own m
agnanimity and that 
there were particula
r reasons for buonap
artes hatred of him.
 ah yes do tell us a
ll about it vicomte 
said anna pavlovna w
ith a pleasant feeli
ng that there was so
mething a la louis x
v in the sound of th
at sentence contez n
ous cela vicomte. th
e vicomte bowed and 
smiled courteously i
n token of his willi
ngness to comply. an
na pavlovna arranged
 a group round him i
nviting everyone to 
listen to his tale. 
the vicomte knew the
 duc personally whis
pered anna pavlovna 
to one of the guests
. the vicomte is a w
onderful raconteur s
aid she to another. 
how evidently he bel
ongs to the best soc
iety said she to a t
hird and the vicomte
 was served up to th
e company in the cho
icest and most advan
tageous style like a
 wellgarnished joint
 of roast beef on a 
hot dish. the vicomt
e wished to begin hi
s story and gave a s
ubtle smile. come ov
er here helene dear 
said anna pavlovna t
o the beautiful youn
g princess who was s
itting some way off 
the center of anothe
r group. the princes
s smiled. she rose w
ith the same unchang
ing smile with which
 she had first enter
ed the roomthe smile
 of a perfectly beau
tiful woman. with a 
slight rustle of her
 white dress trimmed
 with moss and ivy w
ith a gleam of white
 shoulders glossy ha
ir and sparkling dia
monds she passed bet
ween the men who mad
e way for her not lo
oking at any of them
 but smiling on all 
as if graciously all
owing each the privi
lege of admiring her
 beautiful figure an
d shapely shoulders 
back and bosomwhich 
in the fashion of th
ose days were very m
uch exposed and she 
seemed to bring the 
glamour of a ballroo
m with her as she mo
ved toward anna pavl
ovna. helene was so 
lovely that not only
 did she not show an
y trace of coquetry 
but on the contrary 
she even appeared sh
y of her unquestiona
ble and all too vict
orious beauty. she s
eemed to wish but to
 be unable to dimini
sh its effect. how l
ovely said everyone 
who saw her and the 
vicomte lifted his s
houlders and dropped
 his eyes as if star
tled by something ex
traordinary when she
 took her seat oppos
ite and beamed upon 
him also with her un
changing smile. mada
me i doubt my abilit
y before such an aud
ience said he smilin
gly inclining his he
ad. the princess res
ted her bare round a
rm on a little table
 and considered a re
ply unnecessary. she
 smilingly waited. a
ll the time the stor
y was being told she
 sat upright glancin
g now at her beautif
ul round arm altered
 in shape by its pre
ssure on the table n
ow at her still more
 beautiful bosom on 
which she readjusted
 a diamond necklace.
 from time to time s
he smoothed the fold
s of her dress and w
henever the story pr
oduced an effect she
 glanced at anna pav
lovna at once adopte
d just the expressio
n she saw on the mai
d of honors face and
 again relapsed into
 her radiant smile. 
the little princess 
had also left the te
a table and followed
 helene. wait a mome
nt ill get my work. 
now then what are yo
u thinking of she we
nt on turning to pri
nce hippolyte. fetch
 me my workbag. ther
e was a general move
ment as the princess
 smiling and talking
 merrily to everyone
 at once sat down an

his tale very neatly
. it was an anecdote
 then current to the
 effect that the duc
 denghien had gone s
ecretly to paris to 
visit mademoiselle g
eorge that at her ho
use he came upon bon
aparte who also enjo
yed the famous actre
ss favors and that i
n his presence napol
eon happened to fall
 into one of the fai
nting fits to which 
he was subject and w
as thus at the ducs 
mercy. the latter sp
ared him and this ma
gnanimity bonaparte 
subsequently repaid 
by death. the story 
was very pretty and 
interesting especial
ly at the point wher
e the rivals suddenl
y recognized one ano
ther and the ladies 
looked agitated. cha

 her from going on w

ust then anna pavlov

 he was a very hands

 clearcut features. 
everything about him
 from his weary bore

quiet measured step 
offered a most strik

quiet little wife. i
t was evident that h

to disturb the vicom

was no need to ask t

 holding him down by

said he turning to a

ding up the folds of

eautiful face. pierr
e gazed at her with 
rapturous almost fri
ghtened eyes as she 
passed him. very lov

. in passing prince 
vasili seized pierre

 this bear for me he
 has been staying wi

and this is the firs
t time i have seen h
im in society. nothi
ng is so necessary f
or a young man as th
e society of clever 
women. anna pavlovna
 smiled and promised
 to take pierre in h
and. she knew his fa
ther to be a connect
ion of prince vasili
s. the elderly lady 
who had been sitting
 with the old aunt r
ose hurriedly and ov
ertook prince vasili
 in the anteroom. al
l the affectation of
 interest she had as
sumed had left her k
indly and tearworn f
ace and it now expre
ssed only anxiety an
d fear. how about my
 son boris prince sa

urg. tell me what ne
ws i may take back t
o my poor boy. altho
ugh prince vasili li
stened reluctantly a
nd not very politely
 to the elderly lady
 even betraying some
 impatience she gave
 him an ingratiating
 and appealing smile
 and took his hand t
hat he might not go 
away. what would it 
cost you to say a wo

d then he would be t
ransferred to the gu
ards at once said sh
e. believe me prince
ss i am ready to do 
all i can answered p
rince vasili but it 
is difficult for me 
to ask the emperor. 
i should advise you 
to appeal to rumyant
sev through prince g
olitsyn. that would 
be the best way. the
 elderly lady was a 
princess drubetskaya
 belonging to one of
 the best families i
n russia but she was
 poor and having lon
g been out of societ
y had lost her forme
r influential connec
tions. she had now c
ome to petersburg to
 procure an appointm

r her only son. it w
as in fact solely to
 meet prince vasili 
that she had obtaine
d an invitation to a

s story. prince vasi
lis words frightened
 her an embittered l
ook clouded her once
 handsome face but o

n she smiled again a
nd clutched prince v

 her beautiful head 
and looking over her
 classically molded 
shoulder as she stoo
d waiting by the doo
r. influence in soci

ital which has to be
 economized if it is
 to last. prince vas
ili knew this and ha
ving once realized t
hat if he asked on b

ged of him he would 
soon be unable to as
k for himself he bec
ame chary of using h
is influence. but in
 princess drubetskay
as case he felt afte
r her second appeal 
something like qualm
s of conscience. she
 had reminded him of
 what was quite true
 he had been indebte
d to her father for 
the first steps in h
is career. moreover 
he could see by her 
manners that she was
 one of those women 
mostly motherswho ha

eir minds will not r
est until they have 
gained their end and
 are prepared if nec
essary to go on insi

my dear anna mikhayl

 naturally to her bu

age and by force of

 expression. she ret
urned to the group w

s difficult to know 
the real state of fr

 bonaparte has said 
so remarked prince a

 and though anna pav

 unable to stop him.
 the execution of th

 and began slapping 
his knee with the pa

vicomte merely shrug
ged his shoulders. p
ierre looked solemnl

o he continued despe
rately because the b

 the people to anarc

e understood the rev

it and so for the ge

not stop short for t

life. wont you come 
over to the other ta

continued his speech
 without heeding her
. no cried he becomi

 of it to commit mur

 remarked the vicomt

 gave him power that

d from the vicomte t
o their hostess. in 
the first moment of 
pierres outburst ann
a pavlovna despite h
er social experience
 was horrorstruck. b
ut when she saw that
 pierres sacrilegiou
s words had not exas
perated the vicomte 
and had convinced he
rself that it was im
possible to stop him
 she rallied her for
ces and joined the v
icomte in a vigorous
 attack on the orato

eur pierre said she 
how do you explain t
he fact of a great m
an executing a ducor
 even an ordinary ma
n whois innocent and
 untried i should li
ke said the vicomte 
to ask how monsieur 
explains the th brum
aire was not that an
 imposture it was a 
swindle and not at a

of a great man and t
he prisoners he kill
ed in africa that wa

little princess shru
gging her shoulders.
 hes a low fellow sa

e. pierre not knowin

smiled. his smile wa
s unlike the halfsmi
le of other people. 
when he smiled his g
rave even rather glo

aneously replaced by
 another a childlike
 kindly even rather 
silly look which see
med to ask forgivene
ss. the vicomte who 
was meeting him for 
the first time saw c
learly that this you
ng jacobin was not s
o terrible as his wo

ere silent. how do y
ou expect him to ans
wer you all at once 
said prince andrew. 
besides in the actio
ns of a statesman on
e has to distinguish
 between his acts as
 a private person as
 a general and as an
 emperor. so it seem
s to me. yes yes of 
course pierre chimed
 in pleased at the a
rrival of this reinf
orcement. one must a
dmit continued princ
e andrew that napole
on as a man was grea
t on the bridge of a
rcola and in the hos
pital at jaffa where
 he gave his hand to
 the plaguestricken

ther acts which it i
s difficult to justi

awkwardness of pierr

made a sign to his w

 to go. suddenly pri

d up making signs to
 everyone to attend 
and asking them all 
to be seated began i
 was told a charming
 moscow story today 
and must treat you t
o it. excuse me vico
mtei must tell it in
 russian or the poin
t will be lost. and 
prince hippolyte beg
an to tell his story
 in such russian as 
a frenchman would sp
eak after spending a
bout a year in russi
a. everyone waited s
o emphatically and e
agerly did he demand
 their attention to 
his story. there is 
in moscow a lady une
 dame and she is ver
y stingy. she must h
ave two footmen behi
nd her carriage and 
very big ones. that 
was her taste. and s
he had a ladys maid 
also big. she said. 
here prince hippolyt
e paused evidently c
ollecting his ideas 
with difficulty. she
 said. oh yes she sa
id girl to the maid 
put on a livery get 
up behind the carria
ge and come with me 
while i make some ca

polyte spluttered an
d burst out laughing
 long before his aud
ience which produced
 an effect unfavorab

several persons amon
g them the elderly l
ady and anna pavlovn

 she went. suddenly 
there was a great wi
nd. the girl lost he
r hat and her long h
air came down. here 
he could contain him
self no longer and w
ent on between gasps
 of laughter and the
 whole world knew. a
nd so the anecdote e
nded. though it was 
unintelligible why h
e had told it or why
 it had to be told i
n russian still anna
 pavlovna and the ot
hers appreciated pri
nce hippolytes socia
l tact in so agreeab

pleasant and unamiab

he anecdote the conv

to insignificant sma

out theatricals and 
who would meet whom 
and when and where. 
chapter vi having th
anked anna pavlovna 
for her charming soi

 to take their leave
. pierre was ungainl
y. stout about the a
verage height broad 
with huge red hands 
he did not know as t
he saying is how to 
enter a drawing room
 and still less how 
to leave one that is
 how to say somethin
g particularly agree
able before going aw

was absent minded. w
hen he rose to go he
 took up instead of 
his own the generals
 threecornered hat a
nd held it pulling a
t the plume till the
 general asked him t
o restore it. all hi
s absentmindedness a

redeemed by his kind

 expression. anna pa
vlovna turned toward
 him and with a chri

expressed forgivenes

 are opinions but yo
u see what a capital
 goodnatured fellow 
i am. and everyone i
ncluding anna pavlov

 andrew had gone out
 into the hall and t
urning his shoulders
 to the footman who 
was helping him on w

ed indifferently to 
his wifes chatter wi
th prince hippolyte 
who had also come in

close to her began t

 two footmen the pri

and a cloak waiting 
for the conversation
 to finish. they lis
tened to the french 
sentences which to t
hem were meaningless
 with an air of unde
rstanding but not wi
shing to appear to d
o so. the princess a
s usual spoke smilin
gly and listened wit
h a laugh. i am very
 glad i did not go t
o the ambassadors sa
id prince hippolyte 
so dull. it has been
 a delightful evenin
g has it not delight

replied the princess
 drawing up her down
y little lip. all th

 not all for you wil

lyte smiling joyfull
y and snatching the 
shawl from the footm
an whom he even push
ed aside he began wr
apping it round the 
princess. either fro
m awkwardness or int
entionally no one co
uld have said which 
after the shawl had 
been adjusted he kep
t his arm around her
 for a long time as 
though embracing her
. still smiling she 
gracefully moved awa
y turning and glanci
ng at her husband. p
rince andrews eyes w
ere closed so weary 
and sleepy did he se
em. are you ready he
 asked his wife look
ing past her. prince
 hippolyte hurriedly
 put on his cloak wh
ich in the latest fa
shion reached to his
 very heels and stum
bling in it ran out 
into the porch follo
wing the princess wh
om a footman was hel

cking up her dress w

her husband was adju

retense of helping w
as in everyones way.
 allow me sir said p
rince andrew in russ
ian in a cold disagr
eeable tone to princ
e hippolyte who was 
blocking his path. i
 am expecting you pi
erre said the same v
oice but gently and 
affectionately. the 
postilion started th
e carriage wheels ra

yte laughed spasmodi
cally as he stood in
 the porch waiting f
or the vicomte whom 
he had promised to t
ake home. well mon c
her said the vicomte
 having seated himse
lf beside hippolyte 
in the carriage your
 little princess is 
very nice very nice 
indeed quite french 
and he kissed the ti

ippolyte burst out l
aughing. do you know
 you are a terrible 
chap for all your in
nocent airs continue
d the vicomte. i pit
y the poor husband t
hat little officer w
ho gives himself the
 airs of a monarch. 
hippolyte spluttered
 again and amid his 
laughter said and yo
u were saying that t

w said prince andrew
 as he entered the s
tudy rubbing his sma
ll white hands. pier
re turned his whole 
body making the sofa
 creak. he lifted hi
s eager face to prin
ce andrew smiled and
 waved his hand. tha
t abbe is very inter
esting but he does n
ot see the thing in 
the right light. in 
my opinion perpetual
 peace is possible b
uti do not know how 
to express it. not b
y a balance of polit
ical power. it was e
vident that prince a
ndrew was not intere
sted in such abstrac
t conversation. one 
cant everywhere say 
all one thinks mon c
her. well have you a
t last decided on an
ything are you going
 to be a guardsman o

d prince andrew afte
r a momentary silenc

the sofa with his le
gs tucked under him.
 really i dont yet k
now. i dont like eit
her the one or the o
ther. but you must d
ecide on something y
our father expects i
t. pierre at the age
 of ten had been sen
t abroad with an abb
e as tutor and had r
emained away till he
 was twenty. when he
 returned to moscow 
his father dismissed
 the abbe and said t
o the young man now 
go to petersburg loo
k round and choose y
our profession. i wi
ll agree to anything
. here is a letter t
o prince vasili and 
here is money. write
 to me all about it 
and i will help you 
in everything. pierr
e had already been c
hoosing a career for
 three months and ha
d not decided on any
thing. it was about 
this choice that pri
nce andrew was speak
ing. pierre rubbed h
is forehead. but he 
must be a freemason 
said he referring to
 the abbe whom he ha
d met that evening. 
that is all nonsense
. prince andrew agai
n interrupted him le
t us talk business. 
have you been to the
 horse guards no i h
ave not but this is 
what i have been thi
nking and wanted to 
tell you. there is a
 war now against nap
oleon. if it were a 
war for freedom i co
uld understand it an
d should be the firs
t to enter the army 
but to help england 
and austria against 
the greatest man in 
the world is not rig
ht. prince andrew on
ly shrugged his shou
lders at pierres chi
ldish words. he put 
on the air of one wh
o finds it impossibl
e to reply to such n
onsense but it would
 in fact have been d
ifficult to give any
 other answer than t
he one prince andrew
 gave to this naive 
question. if no one 
fought except on his
 own conviction ther
e would be no wars h
e said. and that wou
ld be splendid said 
pierre. prince andre
w smiled ironically.
 very likely it woul
d be splendid but it
 will never come abo
ut. well why are you
 going to the war as

 i dont know. i must

 settling down brisk

it annette never got

you men all are not 
to have married her 
excuse me for saying
 so but you have no

 fellow you are mons

 still arguing with 
your husband. i cant

 with none of the em
barrassment so commo

s words touched her 
to the quick. ah tha
t is just what i tel

ont in the least und
erstand why men cant
 live without wars. 
how is it that we wo
men dont want anythi

i always tell him he
re he is uncles aide
de camp a most brill

 so well known so mu
ch appreciated by ev
eryone. the other da
y at the apraksins i
 heard a lady asking
 is that the famous 
prince andrew i did 
indeed. she laughed.
 he is so well recei
ved everywhere. he m
ight easily become a

mperor spoke to him 
most graciously. ann

poken to hippolyte i
n the drawing room a

nly illsuited to the
 family circle of wh
ich pierre was almos
t a member. today wh
en i remembered that
 all these delightfu
l associations must 
be broken off. and t
hen you know andre. 
she looked significa
ntly at her husband 
im afraid im afraid 
she whispered and a 
shudder ran down her
 back. her husband l
ooked at her as if s
urprised to notice t
hat someone besides 
pierre and himself w
as in the room and a
ddressed her in a to
ne of frigid politen
ess. what is it you 
are afraid of lise i
 dont understand sai
d he. there what ego
tists men all are al

for a whim of his ow

 in the country. wit
h my father and sist

lone all the same wi
thout my friends. an
d he expects me not 
to be afraid. her to
ne was now querulous
 and her lip drawn u
p giving her not a j
oyful but an animal 
squirrellike express
ion. she paused as i
f she felt it indeco
rous to speak of her
 pregnancy before pi
erre though the gist
 of the matter lay i
n that. i still cant
 understand what you
 are afraid of said 
prince andrew slowly
 not taking his eyes
 off his wife. the p
rincess blushed and 
raised her arms with
 a gesture of despai
r. no andrew i must 
say you have changed
. oh how you have. y
our doctor tells you
 to go to bed earlie

. you had better go.
 the princess said n
othing but suddenly 
her short downy lip 
quivered. prince and

 his mind. why shoul

 you andrew why you 
have changed so to m

o you you are going 
to the war and have 
no pity for me. why 
is it lise was all p
rince andrew said. b

 i see it all did yo

 beg you to desist s

 him by the hand. no

 without restraining
 her angry tears. li

hapter viii the frie

andrew rubbed his fo

d with a sigh going 
to the door. they en
tered the elegant ne
wly decorated and lu
xurious dining room.
 everything from the
 table napkins to th

in the households of
 the newly married. 
halfway through supp
er prince andrew lea
ned his elbows on th
e table and with a l
ook of nervous agita
tion such as pierre 
had never before see
n on his face began 
to talkas one who ha
s long had something
 on his mind and sud
denly determines to 
speak out. never nev
er marry my dear fel
low thats my advice 
never marry till you
 can say to yourself
 that you have done 
all you are capable 
of and until you hav
e ceased to love the
 woman of your choic
e and have seen her 
plainly as she is or
 else you will make 
a cruel and irrevoca
ble mistake. marry w
hen you are old and 
good for nothingor a
ll that is good and 
noble in you will be
 lost. it will all b
e wasted on trifles.
 yes yes yes dont lo
ok at me with such s
urprise. if you marr
y expecting anything
 from yourself in th
e future you will fe
el at every step tha
t for you all is end
ed all is closed exc
ept the drawing room
 where you will be r
anged side by side w
ith a court lackey a
nd an idiot. but wha
ts the good. and he 
waved his arm. pierr
e took off his spect
acles which made his
 face seem different
 and the goodnatured
 expression still mo
re apparent and gaze
d at his friend in a
mazement. my wife co
ntinued prince andre
w is an excellent wo
man one of those rar
e women with whom a 
mans honor is safe b
ut o god what would 
i not give now to be
 unmarried you are t
he first and only on
e to whom i mention 
this because i like 
you. as he said this
 prince andrew was l
ess than ever like t
hat bolkonski who ha
d lolled in anna pav
lovnas easy chairs a
nd with halfclosed e
yes had uttered fren
ch phrases between h
is teeth. every musc
le of his thin face 
was now quivering wi
th nervous excitemen
t his eyes in which 
the fire of life had
 seemed extinguished
 now flashed with br
illiant light. it wa
s evident that the m
ore lifeless he seem
ed at ordinary times
 the more impassione
d he became in these
 moments of almost m
orbid irritation. yo
u dont understand wh
y i say this he cont
inued but it is the 
whole story of life.
 you talk of bonapar
te and his career sa
id he though pierre 
had not mentioned bo
naparte but bonapart
e when he worked wen
t step by step towar
d his goal. he was f
ree he had nothing b
ut his aim to consid
er and he reached it
. but tie yourself u
p with a woman and l
ike a chained convic
t you lose all freed
om and all you have 
of hope and strength
 merely weighs you d
own and torments you
 with regret. drawin
g rooms gossip balls
 vanity and triviali
tythese are the ench
anted circle i canno
t escape from. i am 
now going to the war
 the greatest war th
ere ever was and i k
now nothing and am f
it for nothing. i am
 very amiable and ha
ve a caustic wit con
tinued prince andrew
 and at anna pavlovn
as they listen to me
. and that stupid se

those women. if you 
only knew what those
 society women are a

my father is right. 
selfish vain stupid 
trivial in everythin

in their true colors
 when you meet them 
in society it seems 
as if there were som

heres nothing nothin
g nothing no dont ma
rry my dear fellow d
ont marry concluded 
prince andrew. it se
ems funny to me said
 pierre that you you
 should consider you
rself incapable and 
your life a spoiled 
life. you have every
thing before you eve
rything. and you. he
 did not finish his 
sentence but his ton
e showed how highly 
he thought of his fr
iend and how much he
 expected of him in 
the future. how can 
he talk like that th
ought pierre. he con
sidered his friend a
 model of perfection
 because prince andr
ew possessed in the 
highest degree just 
the very qualities p
ierre lacked and whi
ch might be best des
cribed as strength o
f will. pierre was a
lways astonished at 
prince andrews calm 
manner of treating e
verybody his extraor
dinary memory his ex
tensive reading he h
ad read everything k
new everything and h
ad an opinion about 
everything but above
 all at his capacity
 for work and study.
 and if pierre was o
ften struck by andre
ws lack of capacity 
for philosophical me
ditation to which he
 himself was particu
larly addicted he re
garded even this not
 as a defect but as 
a sign of strength. 
even in the best mos
t friendly and simpl
est relations of lif
e praise and commend
ation are essential 
just as grease is ne
cessary to wheels th
at they may run smoo
thly. my part is pla
yed out said prince 
andrew. whats the us
e of talking about m
e let us talk about 
you he added after a
 silence smiling at 
his reassuring thoug
hts. that smile was 
immediately reflecte
d on pierres face. b
ut what is there to

n he suddenly blushe
d crimson and it was
 plain that he had m
ade a great effort t
o say this. without 
a name and without m

 but he did not say 
what it really was. 
for the present i am
 free and am all rig

r chapter ix it was 
past one oclock when
 pierre left his fri
end. it was a cloudl
ess northern summer 
night. pierre took a
n open cab intending
 to drive straight h
ome. but the nearer 
he drew to the house
 the more he felt th
e impossibility of g
oing to sleep on suc
h a night. it was li
ght enough to see a 
long way in the dese
rted street and it s
eemed more like morn
ing or evening than 
night. on the way pi
erre remembered that
 anatole kuragin was
 expecting the usual
 set for cards that 
evening after which 
there was generally 
a drinking bout fini
shing with visits of
 a kind pierre was v
ery fond of. i shoul
d like to go to kura
gins thought he. but
 he immediately reca
lled his promise to 
prince andrew not to
 go there. then as h
appens to people of 
weak character he de
sired so passionatel
y once more to enjoy
 that dissipation he
 was so accustomed t
o that he decided to
 go. the thought imm
ediately occurred to
 him that his promis
e to prince andrew w
as of no account bec
ause before he gave 
it he had already pr
omised prince anatol
e to come to his gat
hering besides thoug
ht he all such words
 of honor are conven
tional things with n
o definite meaning e
specially if one con
siders that by tomor

or something so extr
aordinary may happen
 to one that honor a
nd dishonor will be 
all the same pierre 
often indulged in re
flections of this so

 ascended the stairs

 whats it all about 
wait a bit he is not

his mouth the most s

 of thousands of rub

spected him more tha

dolokhov could play 
all games and nearly
 always won. however
 much he drank he ne
ver lost his clearhe

 at that time notori

and scapegraces of p

 footmen who were ev
idently flurried and
 intimidated by the 
directions and shout

his swaggering air s

 looking at dolokhov

hammering with the b

one else does the sa

 englishman nodded b

 into english. a thi

r of the life guards
 who had been losing
 that evening climbe

 leaned over and loo
ked down. oh oh oh h
e muttered looking d
own from the window 
at the stones of the
 pavement. shut up c
ried dolokhov pushin

window. the lad jump

to the room tripping
 over his spurs. pla

 he could reach it e
asily dolokhov climb

t both sides of the 
window he adjusted h
imself on his seat l

 left and took up th

ought two candles an
d placed them on the
 window sill though 
it was already quite
 light. dolokhovs ba
ck in his white shir
t and his curly head
 were lit up from bo
th sides. everyone c
rowded to the window
 the englishman in f
ront. pierre stood s
miling but silent. o
ne man older than th
e others present sud
denly pushed forward
 with a scared and a
ngry look and wanted
 to seize hold of do
lokhovs shirt. i say
 this is folly hell 
be killed said this 
more sensible man. a
natole stopped him. 
dont touch him youll
 startle him and the

. what then. eh dolo
khov turned round an
d again holding on w
ith both hands arran
ged himself on his s
eat. if anyone comes
 meddling again said
 he emitting the wor

h his thin compresse
d lips i will throw 
him down there. now 
then saying this he 
again turned round d
ropped his hands too
k the bottle and lif
ted it to his lips t
hrew back his head a
nd raised his free h
and to balance himse
lf. one of the footm
en who had stooped t
o pick up some broke
n glass remained in 
that position withou
t taking his eyes fr
om the window and fr
om dolokhovs back. a
natole stood erect w
ith staring eyes. th
e englishman looked 
on sideways pursing 
up his lips. the man
 who had wished to s
top the affair ran t
o a corner of the ro
om and threw himself
 on a sofa with his 
face to the wall. pi
erre hid his face fr
om which a faint smi
le forgot to fade th
ough his features no
w expressed horror a
nd fear. all were st
ill. pierre took his
 hands from his eyes
. dolokhov still sat
 in the same positio
n only his head was 
thrown further back 
till his curly hair 
touched his shirt co
llar and the hand ho
lding the bottle was
 lifted higher and h
igher and trembled w
ith the effort. the 
bottle was emptying 
perceptibly and risi
ng still higher and 
his head tilting yet
 further back. why i
s it so long thought
 pierre. it seemed t
o him that more than
 half an hour had el
apsed. suddenly dolo
khov made a backward
 movement with his s
pine and his arm tre
mbled nervously this
 was sufficient to c
ause his whole body 
to slip as he sat on
 the sloping ledge. 
as he began slipping
 down his head and a
rm wavered still mor
e with the strain. o
ne hand moved as if 
to clutch the window
 sill but refrained 
from touching it. pi
erre again covered h
is eyes and thought 
he would never open 
them again. suddenly
 he was aware of a s
tir all around. he l
ooked up dolokhov wa
s standing on the wi
ndow sill with a pal
e but radiant face. 
its empty. he threw 
the bottle to the en
glishman who caught 
it neatly. dolokhov 
jumped down. he smel
t strongly of rum. w
ell done. fine fello
w. theres a bet for 
you. devil take you 
came from different 
sides. the englishma
n took out his purse
 and began counting 
out the money. dolok
hov stood frowning a
nd did not speak. pi
erre jumped upon the
 window sill. gentle
men who wishes to be
t with me ill do the
 same thing he sudde
nly cried. even with
out a bet there tell
 them to bring me a 
bottle. ill do it. b

 the table with a de

 if she did not know
 what the visitor al
luded to though she 
had already heard ab
out the cause of cou

s some fifteen times
. thats what comes o
f a modern education
 exclaimed the visit
or. it seems that wh

 i hear he has been 
doing such terrible

 only knows what and
 they have had to su

 visitor. and to thi
nk it is cyril vladi

on who amuses himsel

anner and he was sai
d to be so well educ

s is all that his fo
reign education has 
done for him i hope 
that here in moscow 
no one will receive 
him in spite of his 
money. they wanted t
o introduce him to m

 i should think he h
as a score of them. 
princess anna mikhay
